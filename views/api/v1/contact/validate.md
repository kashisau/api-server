| senderEmail | A valid email address    | The sender's reply email address.                                                          |

#### Expected response

A JSON object supplies feedback on the overall validity of all supplied data (excluding authentication data) as well as assessments of the individual attributes supplied.
 
 ```JSON
 {
  "data": {
    "valid" : false,
    "senderName" : true,
    "senderEmail" : "invalid_email",
    "body" : "min_length"
  }
 }
 ```

Codes are used to communicate the feedback of each individual form field. Potential errors cascade, but only one error per form field will be reported. a boolean `true` indicates a lack of any errors for the field.
 
##### Error codes

| Error           | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `invalid_email` | Indicates that the submitted data for this field was not a syntactically-correct email address. This only applies to the `senderEmail` field. |
| `required`      | This field is required however was not supplied for validation. |
| `min_length`    | The content supplied for this field does not meet the minimum length requirements. |
| `max_length`    | The content supplied for this field exceeds the maximum length allowed. |
